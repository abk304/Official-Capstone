You will find all individual scripts used for different sensors, all of which must be initiated by
installing appropriate drivers/libraries. You will also find the code for the GUI made for the project.
The GUI itself consists of multiple files for art/storage.

Sensors requiring pre-code setup:
1. AD8232 - ADC MCP3008
2. Custom matrix sensor - ADC MCP3008
3. MAX30100
4. DS18B20

The kit must be connected in full - no missing sensors, in order for it to launch the GUI based program
that guides the patient.

The kit uses the Google Cloud Core APIs to transfer data from the Pi to the doctor. Arrangements to set
up the google sheets,program and configure the sheets as well as to pay for Google's services must be 
taken care of prior to any testing or operation.
